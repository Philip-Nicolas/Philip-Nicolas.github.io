Questions and Answers relating to the use of technology in my education.


### 1. Do you feel school is preparing you adequately for your future? Why or why not?
In terms of knowledge, I believe that school is preparing me well for the future. For example, our school's computer science curriculum has allowed me to get a top score of 5 on the AP Computer Science exam.  
However, the MaCS program is more difficult. In the same course that prepared me well enough to score a 5 on the AP exam, I only got a mark of 81%, which for a grade 12 credit is relatively low. Overall, I feel ready for university. However, I don't know if I'll even make it in.

### 2. How do you personally use technology to learn?
Technology influences every aspect of my learning. All of my written work is typed, edited, and usually submitted through computers. This includes everything from creative writing to reports. In math classes, I use online tools such as [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com) and [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) to check answers and find solutions.  
Aditionally, all my scheduling is done online. My calendar is always a tab away, keeping me on track for assignments and reminding me when I need to study.

### 3. Do classes that use more technology appeal to you? Is it easier for you to learn the content?
Classes that use more technology are usually easier for me to keep up with. I am usually a little disorganized, and having course content such as lessons, notes, and excercises available online means that I won't be spending time looking through a disorganized binder. Additionally, the ability to review exact lessons means that I can get correct information while studying, and rely a little less on my notes which may have mistakes.

### 4. Does it matter to you if a teacher uses technology in class? Why or why not?
In the end, each teacher will use the tools they're comfortable using. Wether or not the most advanced tech is employed is not up to me, or any other student. After the teacher gives good lessons and offers all the required material, no matter the format, it's up to students to make the most of it. In the end, the quality of a course is determined by the teacher, not their tools. To me, it doesn't matter if a teacher relies heavily on technology or goes without it. I'll work with their material and do my best.  
Unless it's a programming course. Printing out stacks of paper to hand in a program? Come on...
